# Introduction (WIP PAGE)
Hello! I am __Yomin or Selan__, any works __if related to my name__. Any prns are allowed, i don't really mind, __refrain me from getting called as meow/cat__ though, __any of these things__ which I don't fucking understand that they have these kinds of genders vro, it's not even considered as a gender gng. I mean, it does adds up to your persona, but it isn't really considered to be as __"gender"__, if you get what I mean though. I mostly hangout with my friends in __discord__, or in real life finishing my events and activities that are due. __I rarely come online__ in pony town and I'm only playing that game if my friends tags me along to play with them.

__I'm also an artist freak, but I will be showing my art in discord dms only to avoid people from doing plagiarism.__
